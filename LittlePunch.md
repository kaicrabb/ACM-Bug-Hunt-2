An abandoned 6-month-old baby monkey by the name of the Little Punch has been going viral for having an emotional support orangutan plush toy. He cuddles and carries around this plush toy, still sad that he was abandoned by his mother. Unfortunately, the other monkeys have been bullying Little Punch and teasing him for carrying around his plush toy everywhere. Little Punch asks the other monkeys what he has to do for them to leave him alone. One monkey by the name of Harold tells him that he must write a program that will take in a line with the number of iterations, N, and then determine if the single integer on the following N lines is a happy number. To determine if a number is happy, repeat taking the positive integer and computing a new value by taking each digit, squaring and then summing the results. You should do this until you reach 1 or until there is a cycle of values. If you reach a cycle, the number is not happy; however, if you reach 1, the number is happy.

**Input**<br>
The input consists of the first line, which determines the number of iterations, N.<br>
The following N lines consist of a single positive integer.

**Output**<br>
N lines returning True if the number is happy and False if not
